# California-housing-price-prediction for a regression problem
1. You will navigate with each other with how we can build a machine learning model for a regression problem from scratch !
2. I like begin with a promise to encourage you ! at the end of this notebook you will be able to build ML model and visualize it ! as well as evaluating it by some metrics as the image you see below !!

3. we will navigate with each other in this notebook with our approach to build and choose the right ML for our problem.
